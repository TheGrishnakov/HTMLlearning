This repository contains my HTML notes, document number 7 looks at lists, and doubles as a directory for the entire set of notes.
In some documents working with CSS, in the HTML file, there are multiple lines that link to different HTML files, commenting/uncommenting will allow to look at different parts of the "lesson".
